Microfluidics time-lapse images were analysed by selecting the different Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and saving the ROIs in a zip file. 

In this folder you will find the codes used to analyse the microfluidics results:

1. ImageAnalysis.py, it is a Jython script that consists of extracting the signal intensities from the selected ROIs of the time-lapse images as quantitative values, which are given in a csv file.
   
3. Microfluidics_analysis.jpynb, it is a Python script that consists of processing and analysing the quantitative values obtained using the ImageAnalysis.py script.
